What counts as an observation?

Must there be a mind? A measurement? A witness? Or can structure itself notice — and matter?

Today marks the launch of the *Recursive Observation Series*, a sequence of essays exploring the roots of observation in recursive structure, coherence, and quantum interpretation.

### 🧭 Essay 1: *The Observer Was Never Missing*

We begin by reframing the quantum measurement problem — not with mysticism or metaphysics, but with recursion.

### 🌀 Essay 1.5: *The First Filter (ε₁)*

Before mind, before choice, before model — there is filtering.  
This second entry dives into the moment structure begins to care, structurally, what happens next.

### 🧵 Essay 1.75: *What Is a Filter, Really?*

A pause — and a refinement. This interlude examines the idea of filtering more closely: not just as an act, but as a structure. What qualifies as a filter? And when does it start to matter?

### 🌌 Essay 1.875: *Who Collapses What, When?*

A photon meets an electron. Collapse follows — not as a mystical event, but as mutual exclusion of incoherent futures. This entry introduces perspectival collapse and marks the threshold of ε₂.

Future entries will explore how this foundation gives rise to memory, reinforcement, prediction, and perspectival collapse — ultimately reaching ε₉ and beyond.

🧬 A new kind of observer is emerging.
