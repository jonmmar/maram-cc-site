Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>
<p>Most of us first learn the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out”
(GIGO) in the context of computers. It’s a warning to programmers
and engineers: no matter how clever your algorithms, if your inputs
are flawed, the results will be too. Feed nonsense to a machine, and
it will give you nonsense right back, only faster, and now with a
veneer of technical authority.</p>
<p>What’s less recognized, though just as urgent, is that GIGO
isn’t just a quirk of machines. It’s a condition of humanity. Our
greatest intellects, our most rigorous thinkers, and even our
wisest-seeming experts are just as vulnerable to the perils of
garbage input as any spreadsheet or server.</p>
<p>If anything, intelligence only sharpens the danger. A brilliant
mind can construct dazzling cathedrals of logic atop the sandiest of
foundations. Whole societies have been led astray not by a lack of
reasoning, but by reasoning that never questioned its starting
points. And the more we trust these architects of knowledge, the
farther their errors can travel.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to think wisdom is a matter of sharper logic,
deeper reading, or greater cleverness. But wisdom, at its core, is
the humility to ask: <em>What am I starting with? What assumptions,
habits, or “givens” have crept in unannounced? And how willing am
I </em><em>to </em><em>to question, even to revise, those
foundations?</em></p>
<p>Most of us will admit, if pressed, that our knowledge is limited,
that our views are shaped by circumstance. Yet in practice, we rarely
pause to examine the roots. More often, we get swept along by the
“outputs”: the confident conclusions, the elegant arguments, and
the social proof that reassures us we’re on solid ground. When
those outputs are challenged, we tend to double down, rationalizing
rather than re-examining, mistaking confidence for wisdom.</p>
<p>This is the quiet tyranny of GIGO: not that we are fools, but that
our cleverness blinds us to the hidden garbage at the root. And the
smarter, more influential, or more trusted we become, the more
quietly our unexamined inputs shape the world around us.</p>
<p>True wisdom, then, lies less in never being wrong, and more in the
humility to suspect our own foundations; to question, with curiosity
rather than cynicism, the premises we stand upon; and to accept,
sometimes, that the most important form of progress is not cleverer
output, but cleaner input.</p>
<hr/>

<h3 class="western">The Universal Affliction</h3>
<p>GIGO is often spoken of as if it were a minor technical glitch or
a programmer’s headache. In truth, it is a condition that afflicts
every mind, brilliant and ordinary alike. We like to imagine that
genius is an antidote to error, that intelligence insulates us from
folly. But the uncomfortable reality is that intelligence, when
unchecked by humility, can make matters worse.</p>
<p>The smarter we are, the more skillful our justifications, the more
creative our rationalizations. When we start from flawed or
unexamined premises, our cleverness serves not to reveal the error,
but to conceal it, layering it in ever more sophisticated argument,
until it becomes invisible not only to others, but even to ourselves.</p>
<p>This affliction does not discriminate. It shapes the conclusions
of Nobel laureates and novices, trusted leaders and everyday
citizens. Worse, those who are most trusted, by virtue of reputation,
charisma, or expertise, often have their inputs scrutinized the
least. Their errors are quietly inherited by entire communities,
institutions, and generations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the consequences are minor: a fad diet, a trendy
management theory, a stubborn misunderstanding that lingers in the
margins. Other times, they are profound: a scientific dogma that
blinds researchers for decades, a flawed economic policy that shapes
the fortunes of millions, a moral conviction that justifies cruelty
in the name of progress.</p>
<p>The tragedy is not that we are error-prone, but that we so rarely
see where the errors begin. The more impressive the output, the more
we are tempted to overlook the input. The more comfortable the
consensus, the more reluctant we become to question what lies
beneath.</p>
<p>Recognizing this affliction is not an act of cynicism or despair,
but of clarity. It is the beginning of a more honest relationship
with our own minds, and with the minds we most admire.</p>
<h3 class="western">Quiet Catastrophes: When Garbage Spreads</h3>
<p>It’s easy to spot GIGO at work in hindsight, when the results
are spectacularly wrong, or when a familiar dogma finally collapses.
But most of the time, the consequences of unexamined input spread
quietly, weaving themselves into the fabric of ordinary life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the errors are benign or even comic: a fashionable
theory that fizzles out, or a business trend that fades with last
season’s jargon. But more often, they have staying power. The
history of science is full of elegant, coherent systems built on
sand: the universe of crystal spheres and epicycles that once
explained the stars; the theory of the four humors that shaped
medicine for centuries; entire philosophies and policies that began
with assumptions few bothered to notice, let alone question.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the same pattern recurs in smaller ways. A
committee sets a policy based on a statistic that was misreported
years ago. A generation absorbs a cultural “truth” because it was
repeated with enough confidence by the right authority. Each person
along the chain believes they are acting rationally, applying reason
to the information at hand, never noticing that the root was already
rotten.</p>
<p>This is the subtlety of GIGO: it rarely announces itself as error.
It masquerades as common sense, consensus, or even progress. The more
trusted the expert, the more widely their hidden assumptions are
sown. By the time the problem surfaces, it often seems too big to be
traced back to a single, unexamined input.</p>
<p>We cannot expect to eliminate error. But we can cultivate a habit
of asking, not out of cynicism, but out of a practical humility, what
has been taken for granted, and by whom. If we wish to avoid being
unwitting carriers of someone else’s unexamined assumptions, we
must be willing to pause, now and then, and inspect the origins of
what we “know.”</p>
<h3 class="western">On Balance: Skepticism Without Paralysis</h3>
<p>To recognize the power of GIGO is not to advocate endless
second-guessing or relentless suspicion. We cannot pause to question
every input, scrutinize every axiom, or trace every assumption to its
ultimate origin.  Life demands action. The mind that insists on
certainty before every step will quickly find itself paralyzed,
unable to choose or move for fear that some hidden error remains
unchecked.</p>
<p>Yet the opposite danger is just as real: to grow so weary of
self-examination that we rush forward, trusting whatever seems
plausible or familiar, ignoring warning signs that our foundations
may be faulty. Both extremes, paralysis and rashness, are symptoms of
the same affliction: an all-or-nothing attitude toward uncertainty.</p>
<p>Wisdom, in this context, is the art of balance. It is the practice
of healthy skepticism: knowing when to pause and question, and when
to accept uncertainty and proceed. It is learning to live with the
knowledge that our inputs will always be imperfect, our assumptions
never fully visible, our certainty always provisional.</p>
<p>Humility is not a pose but a discipline: the habit of holding our
beliefs lightly, ready to revise them in the face of new evidence or
deeper understanding. The wise person is not the one who never errs,
but the one who is unafraid to say, “I might be wrong, and I am
willing to learn.”</p>
<p>This humility, toward ourselves, toward experts, and toward the
claims of authority, is not a weakness, but the soil in which better
judgment can grow.</p>
<h3 class="western">The Lure of Plausibility</h3>
<p>One of the subtlest traps in our reasoning is the comfort of
plausibility. When our conclusions seem reasonable, when they fit
with intuition or echo what we already believe, it is easy to mistake
that sense of “rightness” for a sign that our premises are sound.
In practice, many of us use plausibility as a shortcut for deeper
scrutiny. If the answer feels familiar, or if it resonates with those
around us, we assume we’re on solid ground.</p>
<p>Yet plausibility is a famously unreliable compass. I have found,
often to my surprise, that the very conclusions which seem most
satisfying or obvious can sometimes mask hidden errors at the root.
The mind’s desire for coherence is powerful; it prefers answers
that fit, even if they rest on untested assumptions. In this way,
plausible conclusions can act as camouflage for the quiet intrusion
of GIGO.</p>
<p>Wisdom, then, is not only about seeking what “makes sense,”
but about tracing that sense back to its origins. The right answer is
not always the one that feels most plausible; it is the one that can
withstand a gentle audit of its beginnings.</p>
<h3 class="western">Closing: Intelligence, Wisdom, and the Courage to
Doubt</h3>
<p>It is easy to conflate intelligence with wisdom, to imagine that a
sharper mind is necessarily a clearer guide. But if the lessons of
GIGO teach us anything, it is that intelligence is no guarantee of
sound judgment. Brilliant people are as susceptible as anyone,
sometimes more so, to the blind spots that come from unexamined
inputs and plausible, but mistaken, conclusions.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a remarkable tool, capable of unraveling
complexity and mapping new worlds. But wisdom is the discipline that
tells us when to apply it, and when to step back. Wisdom reminds us
that every mind, however bright, is vulnerable to garbage at the
root. It invites us to use our intelligence not only to build, but to
question and revise, turning its power toward the service of
humility, not just pride.</p>
<p>This does not mean we must distrust every thought, or doubt every
expert. It means we hold both ourselves and those we trust to a
gentler, higher standard: the willingness to say, “I do not know,”
and the courage to ask, “What am I missing?”</p>
<p>If there is virtue in wisdom, it lies not in never being fooled,
but in remaining open to correction. The best use of intelligence is
not to fortify our castles, but to help us notice when the ground
beneath them is shifting.  The world will always run on inputs. Our
hope is not to escape error, but to live with humility, curiosity,
and the quiet strength to begin again, and, with grace and effort, to
recognize and acknowledge garbage out and allow a little wisdom in.</p>
