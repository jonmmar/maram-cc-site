  - Filtering as logical structure—not process, not collapse.

- 🌌 [Who Collapses What, When?](/dispatch/who_collapses)
  - Collapse reframed as exclusion of incoherent futures.

- ✨ [Quantum Experiments Revisited](/dispatch/quantum_experiments)
  - Constraint explains the “strangeness” of measurement.

- 🐈‍⬛ [Paradoxes Reconsidered — From Cat to Constraint](/dispatch/paradoxes_reconsidered)
  - Cat, Monty Hall, and more: all paradoxes resolved by constraint.

  - How memory and the arrow of time emerge from structural necessity.

- 🌀 [What’s the Difference Between Itness and Itchiness?](/dispatch/itness-vs-itchiness)
  - Some fun with philosophy and definitions.

- 🧠 [Chapter 2 Teaser Now Live](/dispatch/ch2-teaser)
