## 🗓️ Dispatch

The latest updates, reflections, and curiosities:

> **Welcome to new explorers:**  
> If you’re reading this in the site’s earliest days, know you’re ahead of the crowd. Experiments, essays, and surprises are taking shape behind the scenes—thanks for wandering in early.

- 🧬 [Recursive Observation Series Launch](/dispatch/recursive-observation-series)
  - The official kickoff: essays on structure, observation, and recursive constraint.

- 🪜 [The Principle of Constraint — Revealing the Rungs on Reality’s Ladder](/dispatch/the_principle_of_constraint)
  - Before anything else, there are constraints. Reality is what satisfies them.

- 👁️ [The Observer Was Never Missing](/dispatch/the_observer_was_never_missing)
  - Observation isn’t mystical—structure already “observes” by persisting.

- 🌀 [The First Filter (ε₁)](/dispatch/the_first_filter)
  - Where constraint first filters what endures.

- 🧵 [What Is a Filter, Really?](/dispatch/what-is-a-filter-really)
  - Filtering as logical structure—not process, not collapse.

- 🌌 [Who Collapses What, When?](/dispatch/who_collapses)
  - Collapse reframed as exclusion of incoherent futures.

- ✨ [Quantum Experiments Revisited](/dispatch/quantum_experiments)
  - Constraint explains the “strangeness” of measurement.

- 🐈‍⬛ [Paradoxes Reconsidered — From Cat to Constraint](/dispatch/paradoxes_reconsidered)
  - Cat, Monty Hall, and more: all paradoxes resolved by constraint.

- 🕰️ [Deepening into ε₂ — Memory, Irreversibility, and the Arrow of Constraint](/dispatch/arrow_of_constraint)
  - How memory and the arrow of time emerge from structural necessity.
  
- 🧩 The Price of Forgetting — Paradoxes of Memory and Collapse (/dispatch/price_of_forgetting)
  - Maxwell’s demon. Landauer’s principle. Black hole information loss. This essay revisits the most enduring paradoxes of irreversibility—and shows how each dissolves when memory is seen not as a thing, but as a structural constraint. What survives is what cannot be undone.

- 🌀 [What’s the Difference Between Itness and Itchiness?](/dispatch/itness-vs-itchiness)
  - Some fun with philosophy and definitions.

- 🧠 [Chapter 2 Teaser Now Live](/dispatch/ch2-teaser)
  - Preview of what's coming in the main text.

- 🦉 [Ratiocination, or Rationalization?](/dispatch/ratiocination_vs_rationalization)
  - Why cleverness is not enough: the ancient and modern trap of intelligence turned to self-justification. Featuring Bacon, James, and recent cognitive science.
