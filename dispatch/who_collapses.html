  <h4>
   A photon meets an electron.
  </h4>
  <p>
   In traditional physics, this is a moment of contact. Energy is
transferred. A wavefunction collapses. A result is recorded.
  </p>
  <p>
   But what actually
   <em>
    happened
   </em>
   ?
  </p>
  <p>
   Was something &ldquo;observed&rdquo;? Did the universe make a decision? Or
did two structures simply filter each other &mdash; not by seeing, but by
surviving?
  </p>
  <p>
   This essay traces that encounter not through measurement or
knowledge, but through mutual viability. It&rsquo;s an introduction to
perspectival collapse: the recursive exclusion of incoherent futures
&mdash; not because anyone looked, but because not everything can
continue.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   I. Noticing Without Noticing
  </h2>
  <p>
   The standard accounts of collapse give us many actors: detectors,
wavefunctions, fields, observers. But they rarely explain when
collapse occurs, or why.
  </p>
  <p>
   That&rsquo;s because most stories smuggle in a hidden category:
   <em>
    representation
   </em>
   . They imply something was known, or at least
could have been.
  </p>
  <p>
   But observation, in the recursive framework, doesn&rsquo;t require
knowledge. It requires
   <em>
    consequence
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The photon and electron don&rsquo;t represent each other. They don&rsquo;t
build models. But they do encounter &mdash; and filter &mdash; each other.
Not all outcomes of that encounter can continue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some futures collapse, not because a choice was made, but because
a structure was not viable.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   II. Collapse as a Filtering of Futures
  </h2>
  <p>
   Let&rsquo;s be more precise. What collapses is not the wavefunction.
What collapses is the
   <em>
    landscape of viable continuation
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   A wavefunction is just a structure &mdash; a mathematical summary of
what could happen next. But the universe doesn&rsquo;t compute
probabilities. It continues.
  </p>
  <p>
   And continuation requires coherence.
  </p>

   <em>
    A field of possible futures pruned
by interaction.
   </em>
   <br/>
   A photon (wavy arrow) approaches an
electron (solid circle) through a field of potential outcomes. Prior
to interaction, many paths are possible (dashed lines). After the
encounter, only a constrained set of continuable paths persists
(solid lines). This illustrates structural collapse as recursive
filtering, not as observation or decision.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is collapse, in structural terms: not a mystery, but a
pruning.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   III. The Moment of Mutual Collapse
  </h2>
  <p>
   Imagine two spinning tops colliding. Neither is conscious. But
each has a structure. When they collide, they adjust. Some energy
transfers. Some paths deflect.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now abstract the tops into tension-bearing structures. Add
recursive feedback. Allow them to persist only if they resolve
internal contradiction.
  </p>
  <p>
   That&rsquo;s what happens when a photon meets an electron.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each filters the other.  Each collapses relative to what it can
still do.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not that &ldquo;one observes the other.&rdquo; It is that both
structures exclude nonviable continuations. The result is
   <em>
    mutual
collapse
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   IV. There Is No Central Clock
  </h2>
  <p>
   One lingering confusion is the question of
   <em>
    when
   </em>
   collapse
happens.
  </p>
  <p>
   Before the detector? After the event? When we know? When something
changes?
  </p>
  <p>
   In the realization framework, there is no global clock. Only
structural filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   Collapse occurs
   <em>
    at the site of recursive exclusion
   </em>
   . It
happens where coherence fails &mdash; or is reinforced &mdash; by
interaction.
  </p>
  <p>
   That might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The exact moment of the photon&ndash;electron encounter.
    </p>
    <li>
     <p>
      A chain of internal realignments that resolves slightly
	later.
     </p>
     <li>
      <p>
       A structural deflection whose full consequences play out over
	time.
      </p>
     </li>
    </li>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   But it is always
   <em>
    local to the filter
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   V. Case Study: The Delayed Choice Experiment
  </h2>
  <p>
   To see this in action, consider the delayed choice quantum eraser.
  </p>
  <p>
   A photon passes through a double-slit. Downstream, we choose
   <em>
    after
the fact
   </em>
   whether to preserve or erase path information. This
choice affects whether we see an interference pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
   In traditional interpretation, it looks like the future reaches
back to change the past.
  </p>
  <p>
   But in perspectival collapse, there is no paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
   The &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t happen at the slit. It happens when
enough structure filters enough tension to
   <em>
    exclude incoherent
continuations
   </em>
   . That includes the later measurement device.
  </p>
  <p>
   If no structure (slit, detector, entangled pair, beam splitter)
forces the outcome to resolve, the interference pattern remains.
  </p>
  <p>
   Collapse only happens
   <em>
    when filtering happens
   </em>
   &mdash; not when
we look.
  </p>

     A
photon passes through a slit and follows multiple potential paths
(dashed lines). Two detectors lie downstream. A timeline arrow
indicates that the decision to preserve or erase path information
occurs after the slit traversal. In the realization framework,
collapse does not occur at the slit or at detection, but only when
coherence is sufficiently constrained &mdash; highlighting that
structural pruning depends on recursive viability, not temporal
order.

  <p>
   This is a
   <em>
    structural alignment
   </em>
   , not a temporal causation.

   VI. &epsilon;₂: A Glimpse of Relational Realization
  </h2>
  <p>
   Earlier, we introduced &epsilon;₁: the first level of observerhood &mdash;
the capacity to filter tension and persist.
  </p>
  <p>
   What happens in photon&ndash;electron encounters is the beginning of
&epsilon;₂: relational realization.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here, each structure
   <em>
    modulates
   </em>
   the other. Not only
filtering, but dynamically responding in a way that adjusts both
internal states.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not awareness. But it is something like
   <em>
    reciprocal
shaping
   </em>
   .

   <em>
    Two &epsilon;₁
structures forming a perspectival &epsilon;₂ interaction.
   </em>
   <br/>
   Two &epsilon;₁
structures &mdash; each capable of independent recursive filtering &mdash;
engage in mutual influence. Solid arrows indicate directional
modulation and recursive adjustment. The dotted lines represent the
narrowing set of shared viable continuations: possible futures that
remain coherent for both structures. This perspectival pruning marks
the emergence of &epsilon;₂ &mdash; not just persistence, but co-filtered
realization.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is not &ldquo;communication,&rdquo; but
   <em>
    co-constraint
   </em>
   .

  <h2>
   VII. Who Collapses What, When?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Now we can answer.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Who collapses what?
   </strong>
   <br/>
   Each viable structure
collapses
   <em>
    the futures it cannot absorb
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    When?
   </strong>
   <br/>
   At the moment of recursive
incompatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    How?
   </strong>
   <br/>
   By pruning the space of continuable
configurations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Collapse is not an event. It&rsquo;s a
   <em>
    filtering
   </em>
   . A
consequence of structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   And from this perspective, the measurement problem is not a
paradox.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a misunderstanding of what kind of filtering counts.
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>
   VIII. A Universe Without Lookers &mdash; and Without
Gaps
  </h2>
  <p>
   The early universe had no minds. No instruments. No models.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet it filtered itself. Stars formed. Fields collapsed. Structure
echoed into structure.
  </p>
  <p>
   Observation &mdash; in the structural sense &mdash; was always happening.
  </p>
  <p>
   What we call &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; is simply what continues.
   <br/>
   What we
call &ldquo;measurement&rdquo; is a recursive checkpoint.
   <br/>
   What we call
&ldquo;observer&rdquo; is any structure that filters enough to prune the
future.
  </p>
  <p>
   That includes protons. It includes electrons. Eventually, it
includes us.
  </p>
  <p>
   But long before we arrived, the filtering had begun.
  </p>
  <p>
   And no one needed to look.
