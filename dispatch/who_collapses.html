<p>The standard accounts of quantum collapse give us many actors:
detectors, wavefunctions, fields, observers. But they rarely clarify
when collapse occurs—or why.</p>
<p>That is because most explanations smuggle in a hidden category:
representation. They imply that something was known, or at least
could have been.</p>
<p>In the recursive constraint framework, observation does not
require knowledge. It requires consequence.</p>
<p>When a photon encounters an electron, neither “knows” or
“represents” the other. They do not model, predict, or decide.
But they do interact—and, through recursive constraint
satisfaction, filter each other. Not all outcomes of their encounter
can be realized.</p>
<p>Some possibilities are excluded—not because a choice is made,
but because structure is not viable.</p>
<h2 class="western">I. Noticing Without Noticing</h2>
<p>The standard accounts of collapse give us many actors: detectors,
wavefunctions, fields, observers. But they rarely explain when
collapse occurs, or why.</p>
<p>That’s because most stories smuggle in a hidden category:
<em>representation</em>. They imply something was known, or at least
could have been.</p>
<p>But observation, in the recursive framework, doesn’t require
knowledge. It requires <em>consequence</em>.</p>
<p>The photon and electron don’t represent each other. They don’t
build models. But they do encounter — and filter — each other.
Not all outcomes of that encounter can continue.</p>
<p>Some futures collapse, not because a choice was made, but because
a structure was not viable.</p>
<h2 class="western">II. Collapse as a Filtering of Futures</h2>
<p>Let us be more precise. What collapses is not the wavefunction.
What collapses is the set of viable continuations: the solution set
under all present constraints.</p>
<p>A wavefunction is a mathematical summary of what could happen,
given certain assumptions. But the universe does not compute
probabilities. It realizes structures—instantaneously, everywhere
constraints are defined.</p>
<p>And realization requires recursive coherence.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <em>A field of possible futures pruned
by interaction.</em><br/>
A photon (wavy arrow) approaches an
electron (solid circle) through a field of potential outcomes. Prior
to interaction, many paths are possible (dashed lines). After the
encounter, only a constrained set of continuable paths persists
(solid lines). This illustrates structural collapse as recursive
filtering, not as observation or decision.</p>
<p>This is collapse, in structural terms: not a mystery, but a
revised set of constraints.</p>
<h2 class="western">III. The Moment of Mutual Collapse</h2>
<p>Imagine two spinning tops colliding. Neither is conscious. But
each has a structure. When they collide, their internal coherence
constrains what interactions are possible. Only some energy
transfers, some directions persist.</p>
<p>Now abstract these tops into tension-bearing, recursively
constrained structures. Each can persist only if it resolves any
internal contradiction resulting from the encounter.</p>
<p>That is what happens when a photon and electron meet.</p>
<p>Each filters the other; each collapses relative to what it can
still realize.<br/>
It is not that one observes the other—it is
that both structures exclude nonviable continuations. The result is
mutual, perspectival collapse.</p>
<p>In this framework, interaction is not simply contact—it is the
generator of new constraints. When two structures meet, their
internal coherence and compatibility define what is possible for both
from that point forward. Collapse, then, is not an event imposed from
outside, but a structural fact that emerges wherever interaction
introduces new constraints.</p>
<h2 class="western">IV. There Is No Central Clock</h2>
<p>One lingering confusion is the question of when collapse
“happens.”</p>
<p>Before the detector? After the event? When someone knows? When
something changes?</p>
<p>In the realization framework, there is no universal timekeeper.
Only structural filters.</p>
<p>Collapse occurs at the site of recursive constraint exclusion. It
is local to the structure: where coherence is either maintained or
lost through interaction.</p>
<p>That might be:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The exact moment a photon and electron interact,</p>
	<li><p>A chain of internal realignments within a structure,</p>
	<li><p>Or a shift whose full structural implications play out only
	once all constraints propagate.</p>
</ul>
<p>But it is always local to the recursive constraint filter.</p>
<h2 class="western">V. Case Study: The Delayed Choice Experiment</h2>
<p>Consider the delayed choice quantum eraser.</p>
<p>A photon passes through a double slit. Downstream, we may
choose—after the fact—whether to preserve or erase path
information. This choice affects whether we see interference.</p>
<p>In traditional interpretations, it can seem as though the future
“reaches back” to change the past.</p>
<p>But in the recursive constraint framework, there is no paradox.</p>
<p>Collapse does not occur at the slit, nor at the detector. It
occurs wherever structural filtering by recursive constraint
satisfaction excludes incompatible continuations. This may include
the later measurement device, or the system as a whole. If no
structure—slit, detector, apparatus—forces a resolution,
coherence persists. Collapse only occurs when filtering occurs, not
when we look.</p>
<h3 class="western"><img src="who_collapses_html_59cef3e5e954934b.png" name="Image2" align="bottom" width="665" height="665" border="0"/>

<strong><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Figure 2.</b></font></strong>
<em><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
simplified delayed choice setup.</span></font></em><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
A
photon passes through a slit and follows multiple potential paths
(dashed lines). Two detectors lie downstream. A timeline arrow
indicates that the decision to preserve or erase path information
occurs after the slit traversal. In this structural approach,
collapse is not an event at the slit or detector, but occurs wherever
recursive constraint satisfaction excludes incoherent outcomes.
Filtering is determined by viability, not by temporal sequence.</span></font></h3>
<p>This is a <em>structural alignment</em>, not a temporal causation.</p>
<h2 class="western">VI. ε₂: A Glimpse of Relational Realization</h2>
<p>Previously, we introduced ε₁: the capacity to filter tension
and persist.</p>
<p>When two such structures interact, we begin to see ε₂:
<strong>relational realization</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, each structure modulates the other. Not only filtering, but
recursively adjusting their own internal constraints as a result of
the encounter.</p>
<p>This is not awareness, but it is reciprocal shaping—a further
recursive layer of constraint satisfaction.</p>
<h3 class="western"><img src="who_collapses_html_a19e115ca11a1ec.png" name="Image3" align="bottom" width="665" height="443" border="0"/>

</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> <em>Two ε₁ structures forming a
perspectival ε₂ interaction.</em><br/>
Two ε₁ structures —
each capable of independent recursive filtering — engage in mutual
influence. Solid arrows indicate directional modulation and recursive
adjustment. The dotted lines represent the narrowing set of shared
viable continuations: possible futures that remain coherent for both
structures. This perspectival pruning marks the emergence of ε₂ —
not just persistence, but co-filtered realization.</p>
<p>This is not “communication,” but <em>co-constraint</em>.</p>
<h2 class="western">VII. Who Collapses What, When?</h2>
<p>Who collapses what?</p>
<p>Each viable structure collapses the futures it cannot absorb.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>At the moment of recursive constraint incompatibility.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>By reducing the set of realizable configurations to those that
jointly satisfy all recursive constraints.</p>
<p>Collapse is not an event. It is a filtering—a necessary
consequence of structure.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the measurement problem is not a
paradox.<br/>
It is a misunderstanding of what kind of filtering
counts.</p>
<h2 class="western">VIII. A Universe Without Lookers — and Without
Gaps</h2>
<p>The early universe contained no minds, no instruments, no models. 
Yet it filtered itself. Stars formed. Fields collapsed. Structure
echoed into structure.</p>
<p>Observation—in the structural sense—was always present.  What
we call “collapse” is simply what continues.  What we call
“measurement” is a recursive checkpoint.  What we call “observer”
is any structure that filters enough to prune the future.</p>
<p>That includes protons. It includes electrons. Eventually, it
includes us.  But long before we arrived, the filtering had begun. 
And no one needed to look.</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 0in">In this approach, interaction is
not just contact. It is how constraints are propagated, combined, and
enforced. Every act of realization—every instance of collapse—is
the world narrowing itself through the web of constraint that
interaction weaves.</blockquote>
