# 🧭 Mysticism Demystified

A quiet but radical question guides this book:

**What makes something real enough to count?**

We follow that question across perception, identity, memory, and coherence—unpacking mysticism not as fantasy, but as a structural echo of what holds things together.

A ship rebuilt plank by plank.  
A person remembering themselves.  
What makes you still you?

This chapter traces the illusion of sameness—and how recursive coherence builds what we call identity.  
It’s not about staying the same. It’s about **persisting just enough** to still count.
