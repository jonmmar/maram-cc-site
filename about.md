# About the Author

**Jonathan Maram** is a retired physicist and engineer turned full-time author. After decades spent building simulations and systems for aerospace and sensor design, he now writes about something even more elusive: reality itself.

He is the author of *Mysticism Demystified*, a deep but accessible exploration of itness, coherence, and structural reality—and of *Realizations of Reality*, a companion project developing the same ideas through recursive simulation and formal modeling.

He lives in Colorado, still experimenting, still thinking recursively.

# About the Work

*Mysticism Demystified* isn’t a book of answers—it’s a framework for asking better questions. It explores what makes something real, how structure becomes self-sustaining, and why our deepest intuitions about meaning might be more scientific than they seem.

The companion project, *Realizations of Reality*, builds these ideas into a simulation model—tracing how itness, coherence, and preference might emerge from nothing but structure itself.
