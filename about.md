# About the Author

**Jonathan Maram** is a retired physicist and engineer turned full-time author. After decades spent building simulations and systems for aerospace and sensor design, he now writes about something even more elusive: reality itself.

He is the author of *Mysticism Demystified*, a deep but accessible exploration of itness, coherence, and structural reality—and of *Realizations of Reality*, a companion project developing the same ideas through recursive simulation and formal modeling.

He lives in Colorado, still experimenting, still thinking recursively.

# About the Work

Mysticism Demystified is a book for readers who sense that something’s off — in the way we speak about perception, reality, or mind. It’s for those who have glimpsed paradox and wanted more than poetry; who have seen scientific models falter at the edge of consciousness or causality; who have begun to suspect that what survives in this world is structure, not story.

This is not a memoir, nor a manifesto. It’s a slow, recursive descent into what makes anything real enough to matter. Drawing on physics, logic, illusion, and constraint, the book walks a path from raw perception to recursive coherence — building a layered account of how structure arises, persists, and begins to model its own continuity.

The companion work, Realizations of Reality, explores these same themes in a different voice — structural, symbolic, simulation-based. Where Mysticism Demystified draws arcs for human eyes, Realizations digs for viable grammar beneath the metaphor.

The goal is not to explain the mind. It’s to show that no mind is needed to explain the origin of structure — and that when minds do arise, they are echoes of recursive survival, not divine exceptions.

If you’ve grown tired of handwaving, or highfalutin paradox without structure beneath it, this project may offer something rarer: clarity that holds.
