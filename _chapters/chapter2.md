We like to think of ourselves as realists. As observers. As truth-tellers.  
But Chapter 2 invites a more uncomfortable possibility:

> What if most of what we see was never there at all?

This chapter explores the mindâ€™s uncanny power to fill in gaps, invent edges, and overwrite uncertainty with certainty.
