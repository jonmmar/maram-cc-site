# 🌀 The Continuity Trap

What makes something the same across time?

A ship rebuilt plank by plank.  
A body changing day by day.  
A person remembering themselves.

This is the first illusion of itness: the confusion between **identity** and **continuity**.

We start with a paradox: the Ship of Theseus.<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-2">2</a>]</sup>  
But what it really carries isn’t just wooden planks.

It carries *you*.

This chapter traces how structures persist—not by staying the same, but by **cohering recursively**, step by step, enough to count.

## The Heap

Where does a heap begin?

This is the Sorites paradox: how many grains of sand make a pile?<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-1">1</a>]</sup>

> Identity, even in heaps, seems to arrive before the final grain.

## Modern Research on the Self

Are we a story we tell ourselves?  
A bundle of memories?  
A recursive model tuned to survive?

Cognitive models like Metzinger’s ego tunnel<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-4">4</a>]</sup> and Dennett’s “center of narrative gravity”<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-5">5</a>]</sup> question whether there’s any fixed self at all.

## The Person You Haven’t Met Yet

What makes *you tomorrow* still *you today*?

Parfit’s thought experiments suggest that what matters is psychological continuity, not strict identity.<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-6">6</a>]</sup>

---

## The Itness of a Wave

This is a useful metaphor. Bateson saw patterns that persist across time as the true markers of identity.<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-11">11</a>]</sup>

Hofstadter went further: what we call a self may just be a strange loop of self-reference.<sup>[<a href="../references.html#ref-12">12</a>]</sup>

## What Cognitive Science Reveals

These illusions—heapness, selfhood, continuity—aren’t meaningless.

They are efficient. Structurally persistent.  
Cognitively viable.

🧠 *What holds you together might not be what you think.*
